# Attention

As it's being maintened by myself and I don't have the API Key on nuget to push the new versions on the same thread, I'll be maintaining it on my own Github so I can control better without having to wait.

Please, open your issues and follow the repository in https://github.com/valfrid-ly/Dapper-Extensions

For a while I'll be looking in the issues here and fixing in my repository.

Thanks

Valfrid
